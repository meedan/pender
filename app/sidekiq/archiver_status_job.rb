# Notes on the rationale for retrying
# 1. I used sidekiqs own retrying/backing off formula as a starting point
#  https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/wiki/Error-Handling#automatic-job-retry
# 2. start retrying:
  # I think ramping up to 4.5 and starting and always adding 5 minutes might be enough.
  # It starts later and increases the intervals faster# 3. interval:
# 4. for how long:
  # 24 hours.
  # If we havenâ€™t been able to get the status after 24 hours should it seems wasteful to keep trying
